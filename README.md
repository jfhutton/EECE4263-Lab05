# Lab05

In this lab you’ll use the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to
communicate wirelessly with a remote NodeMCU-based “LED node”, sending JavaScript
Object Notation (JSON) messages to turn the node’s LED on or off, and receiving
JSON messages from the LED node confirming the LED’s current state.

Additionally, this lab will give you experience using the open-source MQTT-Spy application
to send, receive, filter, and monitor MQTT messages. Also, you’ll interact with an MQTT
broker, becoming familiar with the MQTT architecture, components, and messaging formats.

Finally, you'll design and build a NodeMCU-based MQTT "button node" capable of
sending/receiving MQTT messages wirelessly to/from the "LED node" via an MQTT broker.

This is a one week lab. No formal lab report is required, but you must turn in the
hardcopy prelab, push your final code (.ino and .h files) to your GitHub project repo <b>before</b> the start of lab next week, and demonstrate your working LED controller node at the beginning of lab next week.

Enjoy!
